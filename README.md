Instructions:

  *Alphabet Soup Problem*:
  - The alphabet_soup function takes a word as input and returns the letters of the word sorted in alphabetical order.
      > If the input is invalid (too short or contains non-alphabetic characters), the program will display the error message "You did not put a valid word" and ask the user to enter another word.
      > Once a valid word is provided, the function sorts the letters alphabetically using both *sorted()* and *key=str.lower* (this makes the sorting case-insensitive), then the "".join() will combine the sorted string, leaving no spaces in between.
      > Once done, prints the arranged string
    
  *Emoticon Problem*:
  - The emotify function takes a sentence as input and replaces certain words with their corresponding emoticons.
      > It uses a dictionary (emojis) which links specific words as emoticons:
         > "smile" â†’ :)
         > "grin" â†’ :D
         > "sad" â†’ :((
         > "mad" â†’ >:(
      > The sentence is split into words using *.split()*. Then, each word is checked using *for* against the dictionary (uses *.lower()* to make it case-insensitive).
      > If the word exists in the dictionary, it is replaced with its matching emoticon; otherwise, it stays the same.
      > Finally, the words are joined back into a single sentence using *" ".join()* and returned.
      > Once done, prints out the new sentence
      
  *Unpacking List Problem*:
  - The unpack_list function takes a list as input and splits it into three parts:
      > First: gets the first element in the list using *lst[0]*
      > Middle: gets every element between the first and last using *lst[1, -1]*
      > Last: get the last element in the list using *lst[-1]*
  - It then returns these three variables together as a tuple using *return*.
  - Once done, it prints the three variables from the input.
